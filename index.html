  <h1>Deep Dash Privacy Policy</h1>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Deep Dash is a mobile game developed by an independent creator. This privacy policy explains how user data is handled within the app. Deep Dash does not collect, store, or share personal information directly. However, third-party advertising and platform services integrated into the app may process limited data to display ads, improve performance, and ensure proper operation.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>Deep Dash itself does not collect or store any personal data. However, third-party services may automatically collect certain device and usage information such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID, IDFA)</li>
    <li>Approximate location (for ad relevance)</li>
    <li>App usage and interaction data</li>
    <li>Network and device type</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is processed only by the third-party providers to deliver and optimize ads.</p>

  <h2>3. Advertising and Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Deep Dash uses <strong>Unity LevelPlay (IronSource)</strong> as its ad mediation platform. This means that multiple ad networks may serve ads within the game through LevelPlay. These services may collect and process data in accordance with their own privacy policies.</p>

    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>If additional ad networks are integrated in the future, they will be used only through Unity LevelPlay and governed by their own privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>4. How Data Is Used</h2>
  <p>Third-party providers may use collected data to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Deliver personalized or contextual ads</li>
    <li>Measure ad performance and prevent fraud</li>
    <li>Improve their services and relevance of content</li>
    <li>Comply with platform and legal requirements</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Deep Dash does not access or store this data. All processing occurs under the control of the third-party providers.</p>

  <h2>5. Consent and Ad Preferences</h2>
  <p>On first launch, users may be asked for consent regarding personalized ads where required by law (such as in the EU or UK). Users can change their ad consent or reset their device advertising ID through system settings on their Android or iOS device.</p>

  <h2>6. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Deep Dash is intended for a general audience and is not directed toward children under the age of 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information through a third-party service, please contact that service directly to request removal.</p>

  <h2>7. Your Rights and Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact the developer:</p>
  <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:loadandrungames@gmail.com">loadandrungames@gmail.com</a></p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>This privacy policy may be updated periodically. Updates will be posted within the app or on the official website. Continued use of Deep Dash after changes are made constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
